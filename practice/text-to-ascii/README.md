## ASCII Code Viewer

This program was developed as a practice exercise while studying the CS50 course.

The application prompts the user to enter a text string and then iterates through each character of the string, displaying both the character itself and its corresponding ASCII code. The program stops processing when it reaches the null terminator (`'\0'`), which marks the end of the string in C.

The goal of this program is to practice essential C programming concepts, such as:

- Strings as arrays of characters  
- Character indexing and traversal  
- Loops (`for`)  
- ASCII representation of characters  
- Use of the CS50 library for user input  
- Understanding the null terminator (`'\0'`)  

This exercise is part of my learning process with CS50 and helps reinforce how strings and characters are handled at a low level in the C language.
