## Average Calculator

This program was developed as a practice exercise while studying the CS50 course.

The application asks the user how many grades will be entered and then prompts for each grade individually. The values are stored in an array, summed during input, and finally used to calculate the average. Casting is applied to ensure accurate floating-point division.

The goal of this program is to practice essential C programming concepts, such as:

- Arrays and indexed access  
- Loops (`for`)  
- User input with CS50 library functions  
- Type casting for floating-point calculations  
- Basic arithmetic operations  

This exercise is part of my learning process with CS50 and helps reinforce the fundamentals of data handling and control flow in C.
