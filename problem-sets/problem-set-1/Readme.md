## Mario More (Pyramid)

This is a small practice project developed while studying **CS50**.

This program is the **first exercise of Problem Set 1**. It asks the user for the pyramid height and then prints a **double-sided pyramid** made of `#` characters in the terminal, inspired by the *Mario (more comfortable)* challenge.

Input validation is handled using a `do-while` loop to ensure only positive values are accepted.

The pyramid is right-aligned on the left side and mirrored on the right side, with a fixed gap between them.

The goal of this project is to practice:
- Functions and function prototypes
- Input validation using `do-while`
- Nested loops
- Modular code organization
- Basic program structure in C

This project is part of my learning process and experimentation with **CS50 Problem Set 1** exercises, focusing on clarity, structure, and clean code.
