## Hash Block

This is a small practice project developed while studying CS50.

The program asks the user for the number of rows and columns and then prints a rectangular block made of `#` characters in the terminal. Input validation is handled using `do-while` loops to ensure only positive values are accepted.

The goal of this project is to practice:
- Functions and function prototypes
- Input validation
- Nested loops
- Basic program structure in C

This project is part of my learning process and experimentation with CS50 exercises.
